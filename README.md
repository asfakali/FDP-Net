## ðŸ”¬ Overview  

FDP-Net is a **lightweight deep learning model** for medical image classification.  
Key contributions:  

- **Depthwise and Pointwise Feature Fusion (DPFF) Block** for efficient feature extraction.  
- **Dynamic Pooling** â€“ a learnable alternative to traditional max pooling.  
- **Fourier Transform (FT) Guidance** with multi-task loss for faster convergence and reduced overfitting.

The model achieves **state-of-the-art performance** while keeping parameters as low as **0.349M**, making it suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments.
